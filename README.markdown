# jquery.dateRange #

## About ##
This is a very simple and lightweight date range picker. It is extensible but not highly configurable. Do not expect a feature rich widget rather a base upon which something can be built per requirement. Thanks to [Karl Seguin](https://github.com/karlseguin/ "Karl Seguin's github profile") for this excellent work.

## Requirement ##
jQuery 1.6.1 (though I have not tested it with lower versions)
