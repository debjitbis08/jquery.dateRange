It is extensible but not highly configurable. Do not expect a feature rich widget rather a base upon which something can be built per requirement. Thanks to [Karl Seguin](https://github.com/karlseguin/ \"Karl Seguin's github profile\") for this excellent work.\r\n\r\n## Features Supported ##\r\n* Lot more configuration options.\r\n* Localization now supported but has to be supplied as configuration.\r\n* Shortcut support, for example Last month, Previous Month etc. These have to be passed in through configuration, nothing built-in.\r\n\r\n## Specifying Shortcuts ##\r\nShortcuts configuration property is an array of objects with two properties 'element' and 'callback'. The 'element' property will contain the text to be displayed and the callback a function which returns a date range. For example:\r\n\r\n    shortcuts: [\r\n      {\r\n        'element': 'This Month',\r\n        'callback': function () {\r\n          var today = new Date(),\r\n              from = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 1, 0, 0, 0),\r\n              to = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate(), 0, 0, 0);\r\n\r\n          return [from, today];\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        'element': 'Last Month',\r\n        'callback': function () {\r\n          var today = new Date(),\r\n              from = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth() - 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),\r\n              to = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 0, 0, 0, 0);\r\n          \r\n          return [from, to];\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirement ##\r\njQuery 1.6.1 (though I have not tested it with lower versions)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
